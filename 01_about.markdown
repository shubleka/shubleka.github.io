I am an independent school educator and technology enthusiast from the New England region in the United States, where I have taught upper level mathematics and computer science for nearly two decades. In addition to coding and mathematics, I'm interested in foreign languages, (world) football, hiking, jogging, and sports in general. On this site I hope to post content related to my interests.

If you have questions or comments, drop me a note from the 'contact' page.
