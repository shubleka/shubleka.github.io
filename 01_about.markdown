I am an educator and technology enthusiast from the New England region in the United States, where I have taught for nearly two decades. In addition to coding and mathematics I'm interested in foreign languages, (world) football, and sports in general. This website does not have a specific goal or theme at the moment, but I do hope to share tips and tutorials from my subjects of interest.
