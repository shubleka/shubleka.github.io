I am an independent school educator and technology enthusiast from the New England region in the United States, where I have taught mathematics and computer science for nearly two decades. In addition to coding and mathematics, I'm interested in foreign languages, (world) football, hiking, jogging, and sports in general. On this site I hope to post tips and tutorials on academics and technology topics, or just my thoughts and observations on teaching and learning.

If you have questions or comments, drop me a note through the web form on the 'contact' page.
